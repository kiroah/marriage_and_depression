    "   * __Data assumptions:__\n",
    "      * SUTVA - We assume there's no spillover effect, and marriage \"treatment\" is the same across people. The latter is fixed such that marriage = having legal notice, but the effect is hard to justify it is equal among everyone. Nevertheless, we will assume so. \n",
    "   * List of responders is not completely random, as the sampling is done in two methods, listed below: \n",
    "      * A cross-sectional sample of 6,748 respondents designed to be representative of people living in the United States during the initial survey round and born between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1984. For more information on representativeness of sample, see NLSY97 Technical Sampling Report (2000).\n",
    "      * A supplemental sample of 2,236 respondents designed to oversample Hispanic/Latino and black people living in the United States during the initial survey round and born during the same period as the cross-sectional sample.\n",
    "   * This is using logitudinal data however it's not really a panel data analysis since we are not comparing two points in time (as data is not available)\n",
    "   * We will mainly use the 2019 data as it's pre-COVID, but may look at 2021 data for comparison\n",
    "   * To reduce dependency between rounds (i.e. need to run previous rounds prior to running next round), some code may be redundant between rounds\n",
    "   * At some point PCA can be used but is not being done here as I have not really studied PCA yet. \n"
